### Steps

- User select the date range to search hotels
- Display all hotels whose availability dates lies between the search dates.
- Display the total number of nights based on selected date range. (For example if user search from Aug 12, 2017 to Aug 17, 2017 than Total Number of Nights will be 5.)
- Display hotel price based on number of nights. (Price x Number of Nights)

### Features

- User is able to sort based on hotel name and price
- User is able to filter based on hotel name and price


### Consideration:
- You should consume the api endpoint mention and not use it as internal json file
- You should build this application in ECMAScript 6 or later, you are free to use any javascript framework.

### Delivery:
- Create public github repo which contain the final code
- Update Repo README file to have all needed instructions to run the application, and include some examples
- Unit test should be included

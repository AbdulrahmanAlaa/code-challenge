## Challenge

Using the following endpoint : https://api.myjson.com/bins/tl0bp 

Build an application (console or REST API) to enable search in this inventory using the following critria:

- Hotel Name
- Destination [City]
- Price range [ex: $100:$200]
- Date range [ex: 10-10-2020:15-10-2020]

and allow sort by:
- Hotel Name 
- Price


Consideration:
- You should consume the api endpoint mention and not use it as internal json file
- You should build this application to work in PHP 7.1 or later, you are free to use any php framework or to build it completley from scraptch
- Don't use any database systems or full text search engines like elasticsearch or solar

Delivery:
- Create public github repo which contain the final code
- Update Repo README file to have all needed instructions to run the application, and include some examples
- Unit test should be included
